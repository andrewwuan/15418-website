<h4>Goals</h4>
<p>We aim to implement a state-of-the-art GPU ray tracer with optimized parallel bounding volume hierarchies. Our first goal is to build a ray tracer that runs parallelly on GPU. Our second goal is to construct parallel bounding volume hierarchies on GPU according to <b>Tero Karras</b>’s <i>Maximizing Parallelism in the Construction of BVHs, Octrees, and k-d Trees</i>. Our third goal is to optimize the bounding volume hierarchies according to <b>Tero Karras</b>’s and <b>Timo Aila</b>’s <i>Fast Parallel Construction of High-Quality Bounding Volume Hierarchies</i>.
</p>

<h4>Challenges</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Karras 2012</b>: Most methods that generate BVH trees do so in a level-sequential fashion (one level at a time). This limits the amount of parallelism at the top levels of the tree. Also, most methods operate on breadth-first order, though depth-first order would usually be preferable considering data locality and cache hit rates.
<li><b>Karras 2013</b>: It's hard to find a middle ground between BVH traversing performance and tree quality. "The gap between the two types of construction methods is too wide".
<li>It's hard to port a well-developed CPU raytracer to GPU because that would mean porting most of the library functions to CUDA.
<li>It's hard to debug complicate data structures in CUDA because GPU don't give much error information.
</ul>
